<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mmmmm, vegan brownies! These brownies are very gooey, which is a good thing in my book. However, if you prefer them a little more solid, you'll need to bake the brownies longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9X13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Stir together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Pour in water,vegetable oil, and vanilla; mix until well-blended. Spread evenly in the prepared dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is no longer shiny, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into 16 squares.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
